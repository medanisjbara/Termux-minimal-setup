# Termux Minimal Setup

# Introduction
Termux is great, but sometimes installing all the great stuff comes at a cost. In this case it's space usage. Some people might not find this a problem. But for people like me, sticking to minimal alternatives is the way to go.

This repo is a collection of scripts and resources to keep your termux installation minimalistic while still benifiting from most of the functionalities you would need from termux.
